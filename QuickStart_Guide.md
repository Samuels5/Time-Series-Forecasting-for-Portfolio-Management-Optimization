# Quick Start Guide: Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management

This guide provides a quick overview of how to run and interpret the portfolio optimization analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed along with the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook portfolio_optimization_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells in sequence (Cell > Run All)

## Understanding the Results

The notebook is structured in sequential sections:

1. **Data Extraction**: Loading financial data for TSLA, BND, and SPY
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualizations of price trends and volatility
4. **Stationarity Testing**: Statistical tests for time series modeling
5. **ARIMA Model**: Statistical time series forecasting
6. **LSTM Model**: Deep learning approach to forecasting
7. **Model Comparison**: Performance metrics and visual comparison
8. **Future Forecasting**: Generating predictions with confidence intervals
9. **Portfolio Optimization**: Finding optimal asset allocation
10. **Backtesting**: Validating strategy against benchmark

## Key Outputs

Pay special attention to these key results:

- **Optimal Portfolio Weights**: Found in Section 9, these represent the recommended asset allocation
- **Forecasted TSLA Price Trend**: Found in Section 8, showing expected price movement
- **Backtesting Performance**: Found in Section 10, comparing strategy to benchmark

## Customization

To modify the analysis for your specific needs:

- **Change Assets**: Update the `assets` list in Section 1
- **Adjust Date Range**: Modify `start_date` and `end_date` in Section 1
- **Alter Forecast Horizon**: Change `forecast_months` in Section 8
