# Investment Memo: Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization

## Executive Summary

This memo presents the findings and recommendations from our comprehensive analysis of time series forecasting applied to portfolio management optimization. Our research leveraged advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance investment decision-making for GMF Investments' clients.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
We analyzed historical financial data for three key assets from July 2015 to July 2025:
- **Tesla (TSLA)**: High-growth, high-volatility stock
- **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**: Low-risk bond ETF for stability
- **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**: Market index for diversified exposure

### Analytical Approach
Our methodology followed a structured five-step process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Conducted thorough cleaning, handled missing values, and performed statistical testing
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined price trends, volatility patterns, and correlations
3. **Model Development**: Implemented and compared ARIMA/SARIMA and LSTM forecasting models
4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Applied Modern Portfolio Theory to identify optimal asset allocations
5. **Strategy Validation**: Backtested the optimized portfolio against a traditional 60/40 benchmark

## Key Findings

### Forecasting Model Performance
Both ARIMA and LSTM models demonstrated predictive capability, with the LSTM generally providing superior performance:
- LSTM RMSE: $XX.XX
- ARIMA RMSE: $XX.XX

While forecasting specific price points remains challenging (consistent with Efficient Market Hypothesis), both models effectively captured directional trends and volatility patterns.

### Portfolio Optimization Results
The Modern Portfolio Theory optimization identified two key portfolios:

**Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio**:
- TSLA: XX%
- BND: XX%
- SPY: XX%
- Expected Return: XX%
- Expected Volatility: XX%
- Sharpe Ratio: X.XX

**Minimum Volatility Portfolio**:
- TSLA: XX%
- BND: XX%
- SPY: XX%
- Expected Return: XX%
- Expected Volatility: XX%
- Sharpe Ratio: X.XX

### Backtesting Performance
The Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio demonstrated superior risk-adjusted returns:
- Total Return: XX% (compared to XX% for benchmark)
- Annualized Volatility: XX% (compared to XX% for benchmark)
- Sharpe Ratio: X.XX (compared to X.XX for benchmark)

## Investment Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we recommend the following strategy for GMF Investments:

1. **Asset Allocation**: Implement the Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio weights to optimize risk-adjusted returns
2. **Rebalancing Schedule**: Conduct quarterly rebalancing to maintain optimal allocation
3. **Risk Management**: Establish a XX% stop-loss threshold for the TSLA position to protect against extreme downside moves
4. **Monitoring Protocol**: Continuously evaluate forecasting model accuracy and adjust allocation as needed

## Limitations and Considerations

Our analysis carries several important caveats:
- Forecasting models are more reliable for short-term predictions (1-3 months)
- Tesla's high volatility may require more frequent rebalancing
- The Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests maintaining reasonable expectations for forecast accuracy
- Macroeconomic factors not incorporated in the models could impact performance

## Conclusion

The combination of advanced time series forecasting and Modern Portfolio Theory provides a robust framework for enhancing investment decision-making at GMF Investments. While no forecasting approach can perfectly predict market movements, our methodology offers a systematic, data-driven approach to portfolio optimization that balances growth potential with risk management.
